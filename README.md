### Animation Method: Time-Based
In my individual task, I used Time-Based animation to animate the group's Mondrian-inspired artwork.
### What I implemented:
1. SetInternal()
I used setInternal() this function to control the timing of color changes.
2. millis()
In order to develop my Time-Based animation, I explored the official [p5js](https://p5js.org/reference) website and searched for time-related functions.
I found [millis](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/millis/)this function to control timing of color changes and I applied this knowledge in my animation to replace the simple setInterval() logic easier.
I experimented with three different millis()-related examples provided on the site:
- Startup Time (irrelevant, ugly & unnecessary)
- Running Time
- A white circle oscillates left and right on a gray background.
